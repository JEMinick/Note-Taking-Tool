## Description: 

The primary motivation for creating Note-Taking-Tool was to create a simple application that uses the express application.
The problem being addressed and resolved with this app is to create a notes tracking application that I can use from any device that will assist me in organizing my thoughts and keeping track of tasks I need to complete.
By creating this app, I learned the following: the Express web framework for Node.js and deploying a GitHub project to a remote server (heroku).
